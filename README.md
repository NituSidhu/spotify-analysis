# A YoY Review of the Past Decade of Music (2010-2019)
This dataset was acquired through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year) and it goes through the top 50 songs by year in the world by Spotify. There are many ways in which we can be analyzing the data, but in this instance, I'd love to understand the trends that we are seeing with music throughout the years and see if we can derive insights as to what type of music we'll be able to predict that will be popular in 2020. 

We will be analyzing the music based on the following fields: 

* **Beats Per Minute**: The tempo of the song. The average BPM is at 119. 

* **Energy**: a measure from 0 to 100, and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.

* **Danceability**: describes the suitability of a track for dancing. This is based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0 is least danceable and 100 is most danceable.

* **Acousticness**: a confidence measure from 0 to 100 of whether the track is acoustic. 100 represents high confidence that the track is acoustic. Acoustic music, based on this entry from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music), "When music is labeled acoustic, unplugged, or unwired, the assumption seems to be that other types of music are cluttered by technology and overproduction and therefore aren't as pure". So one would think that these two values would coincide with one another.

* **Valence**: a measure from 0 to 100 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (for example happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (for example sad, depressed, angry).
